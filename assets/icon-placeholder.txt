Icon Placeholder Files
======================

For the app to build properly, you'll need to add the following icon files:

1. assets/icon.icns - macOS app icon (1024x1024 recommended)
2. assets/icon.png - General icon file (512x512 or 1024x1024)
3. assets/tray-icon.png - Menu bar tray icon (22x22 for macOS)

You can create these using any image editor or icon generator tool.

For now, the app will work without them, but you'll see warnings during build.
